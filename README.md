# Dotfiles

This repo contains my personal [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) which I use on my MacBook.

I do my best to update them and keep them minimal according to best practices, but you can find far better examples [out there](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles).
